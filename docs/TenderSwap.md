### StableSwap

[Tenderize](tenderize.me), another liquid staking protocol, already has a light-weight StableSwap [implementation](https://docs.tenderize.me/contracts/liquidity/tenderswap). Curve is pretty complicated with how their gauges, governance, and factories are setup, so this is suitable for now. The pools act in the same way as Curve pools so our work will be easily portable once we move to mainnet. The contracts were downloaded from Etherscan using this [site](https://smart-contract-downloader.vercel.app/).
